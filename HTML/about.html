					<h2>Current Generation</h2>
					<p>Both Clinton and Jeannine have since passed, and the ranch is now in the hands of their children. The 2nd generation wishes to honor their parents' legacy and make them proud as they watch over the Bar4L Ranch from Heaven! Near the front gate, visitors can see the memorial stone where we show our love and respect for family members who have moved on from this life.</p>

					<h2>The Purpose</h2>
					<p>The Bar4L Ranch is a small, family-operated cattle ranch that also serves as a
						retreat. This self-sustaining sanctuary provides refuge for its namesake so long as they tend to the angus herd grazing the grassland.</p>
