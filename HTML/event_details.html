						<h3>Saturday</h3>
						<p>This day is mainly open for people who want to make an entire weekend of the eclipse and don't want to travel on Sunday or Monday. Guests are welcome to arrive anytime between noon and midnight. We'll lock the front gate at midnight, so please plan accordingly. If you arrive early, you could enjoy the festivities in the town of Lampasas, go golfing in town, visit the Lampasas arcade center with the kids, or simply set up and relax on the property.</p>

						<h3>Sunday</h3>
						<p>Like Saturday, this is another travel day for many people who want to arrive before the day of the eclipse. We will have three events this day though: a bike ride, church service, and a bonfire.</p>
						<h4>Bike Ride</h4>
						<p>The route will be to Burnet County Park and back. The park is about 20 miles from the front gate of our property. The roads aren't the best: a lot of chip sill. However, we think you will have a fun time and more importantly won't miss out on a good training ride if you come see the eclipse! We suggest people drive their vehicles and park near the front gate for the ride so they don't have to walk (or ride) on our rocky dirt roads. We won't be grinding gears (though there is one gnarly incline towards Lake Buchanan), but we suspect the ride will average 15-18mph. We will rest at the park and make sure everyone is accounted for before heading back to the ranch.</p>
						<h4>Church</h4>
						<p>The service will be non-denominational and will include acoustic worship music and a short message out by one of our ponds and underneath the shade of a grove of trees, weather permitting. In the case of inclement weather, the service will move to our main barn.</p>
						<h4>Bonfire</h4>
						<p>Bring your s'more supplies! Subject to weather and if there is a burn ban, we plan to have a medium-sized bonfire for everyone to enjoy near one of our ponds. It won't be able to compete with the Aggie Bonfire, but should still offer plenty of enjoyment doing what people have done for many many moons: staring into a fire and looking at the stars.</p>

						<h3>Monday</h3>
						<p>Today's the big day! In addition to the main event, the eclipse, we all also put on a skeet shooting competition for anyone who wants to sign up. Check-in for Day-Pass visitors will open at 9 AM.</p>
						<h4>Skeet-Shooting Tournament</h4>
						<p>The Bar4L Ranch used to be known for its annual skeet shootout, but that has since fallen by the wayside. This competition is not a revamping of that old tradition, which used to get pretty rowdy. Instead, this event will be a friendly, laid back way to enjoy shooting skeet out in the country.</p>
						<p>Children are welcome to participate but must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. Use your judgement as to whether your child should participate (how likely are they to do something dangerous with a loaded weapon?). Depending on how many sign up, we may have a dedicated youth bracket for those under 16.</p>
						<p>Since we have no idea who may come to this event, security will be on site and we will cover safe weapons handling before throwing any clay up in the air. Competitors must bring their own shotguns and shells. Please keep your shotguns unloaded and cased outside of the competition area.</p>
						<p>The deadline to sign up will be one week before the eclipse, 11:59 PM Sunday April 1st (not a joke). Only people who email us to register will be entered into the competition (click on the button below or the email icon at the footer). We need y'all to do us a solid favor and actually sign up by this deadline so we can have a good idea on the magnitude of the event and make the process smooth and enjoyable for everyone. <strong>Everyone must sign the hold-harmless agreement AT THE EVENT in order to participate.</strong></p>

						<h4>Eclipse</h4>
						<p>Enjoy the spectacle however you like though we ask that you be kind and courteous to those around you and of course still abide by the general rules. You should have received eclipse glasses when you checked in, so just make sure you keep track of them as we won't plan on having many extras. Once the eclipse ends, you should have plenty of time to pack up and leave. Our goal is to have everyone out by 6 PM, which should be great timing to stop by Storm's for dinner on your way out! (It's a family tradition)</p>
