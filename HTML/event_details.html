						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>Welcome to our family's ranch and retreat from the big city! We love it in the Hill Country and want to share our little piece of heaven with the solar eclipse enthusiasts or those who just want to get out of town to enjoy a family-friendly outdoor campout on a working cattle ranch. Lampasas is known as the Gateway to the Texas Hill Country where the bluebonnets and wildflowers are in full bloom in March/April. It is the prettiest time of year to come in for a visit! The Bar4L Ranch is a little over 300 acres of rolling hills with 3 small ponds and dry creek that runs through the property. We have about 250 acres of cleared grazing pastures for our Black Angus cattle and another 50 acres of wildlife areas that are heavily wooded. We have neighbors with high-fenced ranches on 3 of the 4 bordering fence lines where they raise exotics. If you look hard across the high fences, you may get a peak at a variety of exotic animals. The Bar4L is located in the Texas Hill Country where there are alot of old Oak trees, Mesquite trees, Cedar trees and cactus. The area is typically very dry with hard rocky soil that can be hard to dig into so bring appropriate tools if you need to dig into the ground for tent stakes.</p>

						<h3>Wildlife</h3>
						<p>While visiting the Bar4L, you will surely see some wildlife other than the Black Angus cattle and our horse. You may see things like birds, armadillos, deer, racoons, jackrabbits, an occasional hog, and yes, even snakes. We don't see them often but if we do it is typically a rattlesnake.</p>
						<h3>Community</h3>
						<p>We will have a community area with some food vendors and Texas-style games like cornhole, hillbilly golf, and even learn to rope with a cattle dummy. At dusk, we will have an outdoor movie under the stars. And you can't have a campout without a large community campfire where you can bring your own guitar and stuff for S'mores! And don't forget to do some star gazing while you are far away from the big city lights.</p>
						<h3>Personal Gear</h3>
						<p>Feel free to bring things to enjoy while you are on the ranch, like mountain bikes, fishing poles, romping boots, binoculars, telescope, etc. Guests are welcome to bring their golf carts or side by side (Rangers, Mules, etc) but NO motor vehicles like 4 wheelers or dirt bikes are allowed. We ask that only licensed drivers (16 years and older) are in the driver's seat of golf carts or side by side's and drive responsibly for everyone's safety.</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>Safety</h3>
						<p>To ensure everyone's safety, we will have hired security personnel during the event and a nurses station for minor injuries. The City of Lampasas is a 15 minute drive from the ranch and the local law and fire departments have been advised of our private camping event in case of an emergency. We will also have some porta-potties stationed at the community area. Keep in mind, other than porta-potties, there are no public bathrooms or showers so it will be important for you to plan accordingly. Make sure your RV/Camper restrooms are in good working condition and you have plenty of fresh water in your water tank and your water pump works!</p>

						<h3>Saturday</h3>
						<p>This day is mainly open for people who want to make an entire weekend of the eclipse and don't want to travel on Sunday or Monday. Guests are welcome to arrive anytime between 12-6pm. It is best to arrive by 6pm to ensure at least an hour or two of daylight for setup. If you need late-arrival, please let us know. If you arrive early, you could enjoy the festivities in the town of Lampasas, go golfing in town, visit the Lampasas arcade center with the kids, visit the local winery, or relax in the park by the river that runs through town.</p>
						<h4>Hay Ride</h4>
						<p>We will have a hay ride for anyone that wants to explore the ranch behind a tractor. Will pull a trailer with our green John Deere tractor or our Ranger.</p>
						<h4>Movie Under the Stars</h4>
						<p>Come enjoy a family-friendly (PG or PG-13, most likely first two episodes of original Star Wars trilogy) movie in the great outdoors. Bring your camping chairs and blankets to curl up under the stars. It gets chilly in the evenings, so you will want to bundle up!</p>
						<h4>Campfire</h4>
						<p>Bring s'more sustenance! Subject to weather and burn ban, we plan to have a community campfire for everyone to enjoy. It won't rival the Aggie Bonfire but will still provide people the opportunity to do what our ancestors have done for many moons -- stare into a fire and look at the stars. The ranch is a dry, arid environment, so we are taking the proper precautions to ensure the fire won't get out of hand. We cannot extend this protection to guests starting their own open fires, which is why we aren't allowing them. However, guests are welcomed to use grills or self-contained fire pits.</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>Sunday</h3>
						<p>Like Saturday, this is another travel day for many people who want to arrive before the day of the eclipse. But for those that stayed Saturday night or arrive early on Sunday, you can spend the day enjoying nature by hiking the wooded areas, fishing or canoeing in the ponds, skipping rocks, riding your mountain bikes, or simply resting and reading under the beautiful oak trees.</p>

						<h4>Church</h4>
						<p>We will have our local hometown pastor come in town to lead us in worship and a message on how God created all things, including solar eclipses, and how he uses signs in the sky to communicate with humanity. The service will be non-denominational and open to all who want to attend!</p>

						<h4>Hay Ride, Movie Under the Stars, and campfire</h4>
						<p>Just as Saturday, we will offer a hay ride, movie, and campfire for our guests. We will wind down with another family-friendly outdoor movie (PG or PG-13, most likely the final episode of the original Star Wars trilogy). Then you can relax by a warm fire on a cool spring evening listening to music and maybe even do a dancing in the moonlight. We'll have plenty of Texans around to show you how to two-step and Jitterbug!</p>

						<h3>Monday</h3>
						<p>Today's the big day! For many of us, this will be a once in a lifetime event. Guests can still engage in fun activities on the ranch all morning but when noon rolls around, all eyes will be glued to the sky for the next several hours.</p>

						<h4>Day-Pass</h4>
						<p>Check-in for Day-Pass visitors will be between 9am-12pm. No check-in after 12pm on Monday so that everyone can stop to enjoy the solar eclipse.</p>

						<h4>Eclipse</h4>
						<p>
							Enjoy the stellar spectacle in the sky! Partial eclipse will start at 12:18pm and the total solar eclipse will start at 1:35pm, lasting for 4 minutes and 24.3 seconds! Please be kind and courteous to those around you and abide by the general rules. Please refrain from playing loud music during the eclipse so everyone can share and enjoy the big event. You will receive eclipse glasses (2 per reservation) when you check in, but you may want to bring your own glasses as well, especially if you have more than 2 people in your group. We plan to have some additional glasses for sale, as well as some souvenirs and merchandise, but in limited supply.<br>
							<br>
							We won't rush everyone out the gate once the eclipse ends, so feel free to enjoy the ranch and take your time packing up. When you do prepare to leave, we ask you please pick up your trash and dispose of it in our dumpster. <strong>The event ends and the gate closes at 6pm for all visitors, including Day-Pass guests, so please plan accordingly.</strong> This will be great timing to stop by Storm's for dinner on your way out! -- It's our family tradition.

						<h3>Directions</h3>
						<p>Easiest way to find us is to plug in our address into your preferred Maps app: <u>1340 County Road 106, Lampasas, TX, 76550</u></p>
						<h4>Additional Guidance</h4>
						<p>Lampasas is about an hour northwest of Austin to give you perspective. And the ranch is about 10-15 miles going West from Lampasas. The fastest route according to most Map Apps will suggest you go through a neighborhood and to Farm Road 580, but that route has some gravel dirt roads, cattle guards and some steep dips to go across river streams. We DO NOT recommend guests to take that route if pulling a camper or a large RV.</p>
						<h4>RV and Campers</h4>
						<p>If you are coming with an RV or pulling a camper, we highly recommend you take <b>FM 1478</b> to get to Bar4L Ranch. Starting from the intersection of <em>Fourth St</em> and <em>Hwy 183</em>, the route to the Ranch would go as follows:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Travel <strong>WEST</strong> on <em>West 4th St</em> for 8 blocks to <em>FM 1478</em> (also called <em>South Howe St</em>)</li>
							<li>Turn left to go <strong>SOUTH</strong> on <em>FM 1478</em></li>
							<li>Follow <em>FM 1478</em> for about 9.7 miles until you reach <em>County Road 104</em> (if you pass Naruna Baptist Church on the right, you've gone too far)</li>
							<li>Turn right to go <strong>NORTHWEST</strong> along <em>CR 104</em> for about 2.3 miles until you reach <em>County Road 106</em> (also called <em>Watson-Yeary Rd</em>)</li>
							<li>Turn right to go <strong>NORTHEAST</strong> along <em>CR 106</em> for about 1.3 miles until you see the Bar4L gate on your left</li>
