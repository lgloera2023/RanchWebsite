					<h2>HipCamp</h2>
					<p>Our reservation system is hosted by the 3rd-party vendor HipCamp to ensure visitors have a trusted and streamlined process when reserving their spot. We are opening up our private <b>300 acre cattle ranch</b> so you can enjoy the eclipse with us and other eclipse enthusiasts with the following options:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>RV and Campers</b> - dry and dispersed camping, meaning we have designated areas for RV/Campers in one of our pastures. Consequently, there will be no hookups (no water, electricity or sewage hookups). We provide options for a 1-night stay on Sun, April 7th or a 2-night stay on Sat & Sun, April 6-7th</li>
						<li><b>Tent or Cowboy Camping</b> - you can choose between a 1-night stay on Sun, April 7th or a 2-night stay on Sat & Sun, April 6-7th</li>
						<li><b>Day Pass</b> - one day only on Mon April 8th, the day of the eclipse</li>
					</ul>
